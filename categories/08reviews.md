From William, posted [Here](http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=911890#911890){:target="_blank"}:

> dd instead of debian? For me, it is the flexibility added to what was a minimum dd core. So not only easy to download, but given several flexible boot options and tools (remaster tool and debdog-install being particularly nice). Also of course, the Puppy stance of being able to run dd as root user by default. And then there is the easy choice of save or no save at shutdown - the list goes on. Yet, it IS also pretty much full multiuser Debian compatible - so using DebianDog (and others in same family) is all plus.

Certainly, full Linux Mint is nice, full Debian, full Ubuntu - probably too, but soon I start to miss the Puppy-like flexibility added by DebianDog (including easy pet2deb, apt2sfs, load sfs, so on... and more). Size may be one of the important advantages of DebianDog, but not the main one I think - modern computers have tons of resources and even quite old machines now often have more than enough.

Is DebianDog perfect? No such thing, I'd say, but that's one of the reason for threads like these: to find out what is wrong or could be better or what extra is desired - that is a part of what these threads are for. What I don't think they are for is negative criticism or for negatively commenting or otherwise trying to put down other distributions (including Puppy Linux itself), which all have their own plus points anyway.

William
